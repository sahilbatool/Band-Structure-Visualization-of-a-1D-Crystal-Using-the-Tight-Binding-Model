# Band Structure Visualization of a 1D Crystal Using the Tight-Binding Model
## Contents

- `Band Structure Visualization Tight-Binding.ipynb`  main notebook (Colab/Jupyter).
- `results/`  pre-generated figures (png) for each simulated case.
- `requirements.txt`  minimal dependency list.    

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. The `results/` directory will be created automatically and the PNG figures will be saved there.  
4. To upload to GitHub, either go to  **File** and click **Save a copy in GitHub** from Colab, or download the `.ipynb` from **File** and upload via GitHub web UI or git.

## Dependencies    

See `requirements.txt` for  the required libraries.      
Install via:    
pip install -r requirements.txt    

## Notes 

The repository is intended as a pedagogical demonstration and starting point for more realistic parameterizations (e.g., material-specific tight-binding parameters or multi-orbital Hamiltonians).

## Future Work     

•	Extend the tight-binding model to simulate real materials with higher accuracy. <br>
•	Incorporate realistic parameters and multi-dimensional lattice structures. <br>
•	Introduce s–p orbital hybridization or multiple atomic orbitals per site to simulate complex band interactions. <br>
•	Compare computational results with experimental data for validation. <br>
•	Combine the tight-binding model with Density Functional Theory (DFT) outputs to validate the model for real materials.<br>
•	Prepare a combined publication presenting both theoretical and experimental findings.<br>
